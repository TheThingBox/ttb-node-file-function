<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="file function">
  <p>Just like the core node "function", only that this node loads the script
  to be executed from an actual file on your drive.</p>

  <p>This may help you developing for Node RED. Instead of having to write
  your Javascript code in that small textfield in your browser you can use
  your favorite editor/IDE.</p>

  <p>The filename can be overridden by the <code>msg.<b>filename</b></code> property of the incoming message.</p>

  <p>If no file exists with your given name in 'node-red/flows/local/', an
  empty file with the given name will be created.</p>

  <p>See the
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/emiloberg/node-red-contrib-file-function">
    online documentation for more help
  </a>.</p>
